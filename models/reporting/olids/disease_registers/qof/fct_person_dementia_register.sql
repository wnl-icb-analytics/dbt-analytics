/*
**Dementia Register - QOF Mental Health Quality Measures**

Simple Register

Business Logic:
- Presence of dementia diagnosis (DEM_COD) = on register

Note:
- There are no resolved codes for dementia (dementia is permanent condition)
- There are no age restrictions for dementia register

Clinical Context:
Used for dementia quality measures including:
- Dementia care pathway monitoring
- Cognitive health assessment support
- Memory service referral tracking
- Early detection and ongoing care
