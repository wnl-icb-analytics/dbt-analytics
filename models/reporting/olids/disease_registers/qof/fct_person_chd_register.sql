/*
CHD Register - QOF Cardiovascular Disease Quality Measures
Tracks all patients with coronary heart disease diagnoses.

Business Logic:
- Presence of CHD diagnosis = on register (lifelong condition)
- No resolution codes (CHD is permanent)
- No age restrictions

Clinical Context:
- Used for secondary prevention and cardiovascular risk management

QOF Business Rules:
1. Any CHD diagnosis code qualifies for register inclusion
2. CHD is considered a permanent condition - no resolution
3. Used for secondary prevention medication monitoring
4. Cardiovascular risk management
