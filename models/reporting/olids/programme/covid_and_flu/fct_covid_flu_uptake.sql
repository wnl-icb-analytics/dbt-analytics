/*
Combined COVID and Flu Vaccination Uptake Fact Table

This model combines uptake data from both COVID and flu vaccination programmes 
to support integrated analysis and the COVID and Flu Dashboard.

Key features:
- Unified schema combining both COVID and flu uptake data
- Programme identifier to distinguish between COVID and flu records
- Consistent column structures enabling cross-programme analysis
- Support for year-over-year and programme-to-programme comparison
- Focused on uptake business process without demographics

Multi-Programme Support:
COVID Campaigns:
- COVID Autumn 2024, COVID Spring 2025, COVID Autumn 2025, COVID Spring 2026,
  COVID Autumn 2026

Flu Campaigns: 
- Flu 2024-25, Flu 2025-26, Flu 2026-27

Usage:
- Filter by programme_type for programme-specific analysis
- Use campaign_id for specific campaign analysis
- Join with published_reporting_direct_care.covid_flu_dashboard_base for demographics
- Year-over-year comparison across programmes
