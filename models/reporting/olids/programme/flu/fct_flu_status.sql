/*
Flu Vaccination Status Fact Table

This model provides comprehensive vaccination status tracking including:
1. All vaccination activity (administered, declined, LAIV) with eligibility status
2. Eligible people with no vaccination records
3. Non-eligible people who received vaccinations

Key features:
- Complete vaccination coverage analysis
- Eligibility flags for all records
- Tracks gaps in vaccination (eligible but no record)
- Identifies non-eligible vaccinations
- Works automatically with both current and previous campaigns

This gives a complete picture of vaccination patterns across the population.
