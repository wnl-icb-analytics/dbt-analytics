/*
COVID Asthma Eligibility Rule (Complex)

Business Rule: Person is eligible if they have:
1. An asthma diagnosis (AST_COD) - any time in history
2. AND recent evidence of active asthma management:
   - Asthma inhaled medication (ASTRXM1_COD) since lookback date (12 months), AND
   - 2+ oral steroid prescriptions (ASTRXM2_COD) within any 2-year window, OR
3. OR asthma hospital admission (ASTADM_COD) in last 2 years (sufficient alone)
4. AND aged 5+ years (minimum age for COVID vaccination)

This implements the complex UKHSA steroid window logic with 3 overlapping 2-year periods.
