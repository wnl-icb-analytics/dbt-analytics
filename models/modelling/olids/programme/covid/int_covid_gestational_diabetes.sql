/*
COVID Gestational Diabetes Eligibility Rule

Business Rule: Person is eligible if they have:
1. Gestational diabetes diagnosis (GDM_COD) during pregnancy
2. AND currently pregnant (pregnancy logic)
3. AND aged 16+ years (pregnancy eligibility age)
4. Only eligible in 2024/25 campaigns (broader eligibility)

Pregnancy-specific diabetes that occurs during pregnancy.
This condition is NOT eligible in 2025/26 restricted campaigns.
