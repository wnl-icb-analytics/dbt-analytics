COVID Diabetes Eligibility Rule

Business Rule: Person is eligible if they have:
1. Diabetes diagnosis (DIAB_COD) - latest occurrence
2. AND NOT resolved diabetes (DMRES_COD more recent than diagnosis), OR
3. Addison's disease/pan-hypopituitarism (ADDIS_COD) - any time, OR  
4. Gestational diabetes (via separate int_covid_gestational_diabetes model)
5. AND aged 5+ years (minimum age for COVID vaccination)
6. Only eligible in 2024/25 campaigns (broader eligibility)

Exclusion rule - resolved diabetes patients are excluded unless more recent diagnosis.
This condition is NOT eligible in 2025/26 restricted campaigns.
