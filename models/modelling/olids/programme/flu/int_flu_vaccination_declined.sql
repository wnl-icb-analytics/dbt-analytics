/*
Simplified Flu Vaccination Declined Rule

Business Rule: Person has declined flu vaccination if they have:
1. Vaccination declined code (DECL_COD) OR no consent code (NOCONS_COD) within the campaign period
2. AND have NOT been vaccinated (not in FLUVAX_GROUP) 
3. No age restrictions (applies to all ages)

Date Restrictions: Only considers declined codes after the campaign's vaccination tracking date
to avoid counting historical declines from previous campaigns.

Exclusion rule - tracks people with vaccination declination records.
This is used for reporting/exclusion purposes.
