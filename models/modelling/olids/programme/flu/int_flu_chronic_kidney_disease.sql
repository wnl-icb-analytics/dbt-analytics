/*
Simplified Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) Eligibility Rule

Business Rule: Person is eligible if they have:
1. A direct CKD diagnosis (CKD_COD) - earliest occurrence, OR
2. Latest CKD stage 3-5 code (CKD_35_COD) is more recent than or equal to
   latest any-stage CKD code (CKD_15_COD)
3. AND aged 6 months or older (minimum age for flu vaccination)

The hierarchical logic ensures people with more recent severe CKD stages are included,
even if they have older general CKD codes. This replaces the complex macro logic
with clear, step-by-step SQL.
