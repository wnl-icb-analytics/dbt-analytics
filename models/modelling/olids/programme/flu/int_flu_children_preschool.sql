/*
Children Preschool Age Eligibility Rule

Business Rule: Person is eligible if they are:
1. Born between the campaign-specific date range for preschool children
   (age range varies by campaign year - typically 2-3 years old)
   (dates determined by campaign configuration child_preschool_birth_start/end)

Pure birth date range rule - no clinical codes, just demographics.
Age-agnostic naming allows for year-to-year age range changes.
