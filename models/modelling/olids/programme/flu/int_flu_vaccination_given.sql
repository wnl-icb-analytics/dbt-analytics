/*
Simplified Flu Vaccination Given Rule

Business Rule: Person with flu vaccination status if they have:
1. Flu vaccination administration code (FLUVAX_COD) after specified date, OR
2. Flu vaccination medication (FLURX_COD) after specified date, OR  
3. LAIV vaccination administration code (LAIV_COD) after specified date, OR
4. LAIV vaccination medication (LAIVRX_COD) after specified date
5. No age restrictions (applies to all ages)

Combination rule - tracks people with flu vaccination records (including LAIV).
This is used for tracking/reporting, not eligibility determination.
Note: LAIV vaccinations are included here because LAIV is a type of flu vaccination.
