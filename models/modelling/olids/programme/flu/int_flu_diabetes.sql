/*
Simplified Diabetes Eligibility Rule

Business Rule: Person is eligible if they have:
1. Addison's disease diagnosis (ADDIS_COD) - earliest occurrence, OR
2. Diabetes diagnosis (DIAB_COD) that is NOT superseded by a more recent 
   diabetes resolved code (DMRES_COD)
3. AND aged 6 months or older (minimum age for flu vaccination)

The exclusion logic ensures that people whose diabetes is resolved
are not eligible unless they have a more recent diabetes code.
